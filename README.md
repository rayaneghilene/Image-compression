# Image-compression

Image compression using autoencoders: a deep learning task


# Goal of this lab
Get to know deep learning and PyTorch framework
Learn how to compress images using autoencoders
Understand the differences between JPEG compression and deep learning-based compression
Know how to read and use code given by someone else
# Outline
0 - Introduction and documents reading
1 - Discovering a dataset
2 - Creating a model
3 - Training the model
4 - Testing the model
5 - Reporting the findings
# Disclaimer

We will refer to :

AutoEncoder as AE
Multi Layer Perceptron as MLP
Please make sure that your environment has a GPU. For that, go to:


The code is written in Python and requires the installation of several Python packages, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, and OpenCV.
