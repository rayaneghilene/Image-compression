# Image-compression
![My Project](https://github.com/rayaneghilene/ENSEA_AI_Labs/blob/283948d09f73231c4cfba91becbe4bb01973b4f4/Ensea_linkedin_banner10.png)

## Goal of this lab

Get to know deep learning and PyTorch framework
Learn how to compress images using autoencoders
Understand the differences between JPEG compression and deep learning-based compression
Know how to read and use code given by someone else

## Disclaimer

We will refer to :

AutoEncoder as AE
Multi Layer Perceptron as MLP
Please make sure that your environment has a GPU. For that, go to:


The code is written in Python and requires the installation of several Python packages, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, and OpenCV.
